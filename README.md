  Data Visualization â€“ Age & Gender Distribution
In this project, we created visualizations to better understand the dataset's demographic composition.

Bar Chart (Categorical Variable):
Displays the distribution of the Gender column, showing how many records belong to each category (e.g., Male, Female, Other).

Histogram (Continuous Variable):
Plots the distribution of the Age column, grouping values into bins to reveal trends such as the most common age ranges.

Purpose:
These visualizations help identify patterns, detect imbalances in the dataset, and guide further analysis steps.
